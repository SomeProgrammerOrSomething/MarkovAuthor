Markov Text-Generation from Different Sources

This code has a lot of room for work.
I wrote it when I was just learning Python.

For now, this code uses a file 'pym.txt' that is the narrative-only content of Edgar Allan Poe's "Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym".
So, when running markN.py, make sure the files are in the same directory.
The content is in the public domain.

(To use a different corpus, simply change the file name in the lower portion of the markN.py source code.)
